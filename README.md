# Mark My Search

<i>Mark My Search</i> is a browser extension that finds and highlights phrases.

It takes inspiration from many other extensions, including the legacy SearchWP add-on for Firefox.

## Common uses

Occurrences are marked in the scrollbar. You can step through them by clicking on a keyword in <i>Mark My Search</i>'s toolbar. Keyboard shortcuts are supported for all actions, but how you view and edit them depends on the browser.

**A replacement for the browser's find-in-page (`Ctrl`/`Cmd` + `F`):**

* <i>Mark My Search</i>'s highlighting stays up-to-date on pages with infinite scrolling and other dynamic content.
* You can search for multiple keywords at once.
* You can edit matching options for each keyword:  
  case sensitivity, whole words only, [stemming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stemming) mode, [diacritics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic) sensitivity, and **[regex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) mode**.

**Finding the relevant parts of a page visited from web search:**

* <i>Mark My Search</i> highlights keywords from online searches automatically. This setting is on by default, but it can be changed from the startpage or popup.

**Highlighting a set of keywords on certain websites:**

* <i>Mark My Search</i> can store lists of keywords and highlight them automatically on certain websites.
* You can configure this in the "Keyword Lists" section of the popup.

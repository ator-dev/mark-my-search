# Mark My Search
**Research productivity extension**

**Mark My Search** is a Free and Open Source browser extension intended to render online research more efficient and effective.

It addresses the growing issue of finding answers to your search queries on the web, by facilitating the process of sifting through a multitude of results and taking you where you need to be once you get there. By highlighting the words you searched for across the web, **Mark My Search** lets you instantly know the relevancy of a result, where to find any occurrence of a match, and where your problem is addressed in the most depth.

The extension is free and instant to setup and use, can be disabled temporarily or for any period of time, and intelligently processes pages to provide the best results with the least disruption possible.


## Features and Operation

* TODO


## Advanced Use

**Mark My Search** provides a small set of tightly scoped features to balance efficiency with power. Advanced users can follow these steps to get more out of the extension.

* Individual term jumping: By default, a convenient shortcut is assigned to jump (scroll) between any term occurrences. In Firefox, additional similar shortcuts are provided to 'jump' term 0,1,…. In Chromium-based browsers these cannot be assigned automatically - visit <chrome://extensions/shortcuts> and assign e.g. Alt+1 with Alt+Shift+1, Alt+2…
* Lazy individual term jumping: a shortcut can be assigned to 'toggle select modes', which changes the mode from 'jump to term' to 'choose term'. Once a term is chosen its button will be lighter, and the general term jumping shortcut will instead 'jump' the chosen term.
* Problem reports: You can report problems with the extension, including websites which misbehave when highlighted or where highlighting is incorrect, from the toolbar icon. The report option opens a text box where you can input a description of the issue, then sends the following fields anonymously: version number, website URL (in the active tab), terms being highlighted in that website, and your message. The instant report option does the same thing without a description. Thanks for helping improve the extension!
